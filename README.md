Software

Keras (w/ TensorFlow (gpu))
Cuda Toolkit 8.0
Python 3.6 w/ Jupyter Notebook


Run Notes

Run the .ipynb file with Jupyter Notebook

As for the dataset, two folders should be in the same directory:
	a)competition_data/train_images
	b)competition_data/test_images
The image labels should also be included in the same directory (default name train_onelabel.csv)
